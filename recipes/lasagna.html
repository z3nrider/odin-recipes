    <h2>Description</h2>
    <blocktext> Filling and easy to make, lasagnas are great one-dish meals that check all the boxes, as they can be 
      filled with all sorts of veggies, sauces, and proteins, and can be adjusted to many special dietary needs. Our red 
      and white sauce lasagna is a flavorful combination of a basic white sauce, rather than ricotta cheese, and a 
      tomato-based sauce with beef and pork that's flavored with spices and mushrooms. Covered in cheese and baked until 
      golden, this is a great weeknight meal served with a simple salad and crusty bread.We use oven-ready (also called no-boil) 
      lasagna noodles to speed up the cooking time. Simply assemble the lasagna with the uncooked noodles, seal it tight 
      with foil, and bake. As the sauce simmers, the noodles cook all on their own thanks in part to the moisture in the sauces.
      The key is to keep the lasagna covered in the oven until the noodles are soft. 
      Removing the foil allows the upper layer of the lasagna to achieve an appetizing golden color.
      The oven-ready noodles are also available in a gluten-free version if someone in your household has special dietary needs.
      Although a few steps are required to complete this dish, the recipe is fairly simple and can be 
      a great first lasagna for novice cooks. </blocktext>
